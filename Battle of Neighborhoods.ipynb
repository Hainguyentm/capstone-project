    "A company wants to open a food joint in NYC. But it already has many and hence there is real ocean for a food joint to establish there and the strategy has to be bang on. Though the NYC is a homogenous with people of different countries and cultures residing, its still an attractive market. Hence the objective is to reduce risk and increase the ROI by finding the right location for the food joint to open in the New York City. The recommendation should be easy to understand and interpret by the stakeholders so graphics will be of good help."
